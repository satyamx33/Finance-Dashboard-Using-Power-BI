# Finance-Dashboard-using-Power-BI
Developed a Finance Dashboard in Power BI, integrating multiple CSV files into a unified model. Utilized Power Query for data shaping and DAX for advanced calculations. Created interactive visualizations and reports to convert raw data into actionable financial insights, enhancing strategic decision-making.
In this project, nine CSV files were seamlessly integrated into Power BI using the "Get Data" feature. The data was meticulously modeled to create a unified and relational data structure. Advanced DAX queries were crafted to perform complex calculations and generate key financial metrics. The result is a dynamic financial dashboard that transforms raw data into insightful visualizations and reports, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic analysis.
